# Modified-Improved-OCamCalib for OSX
This repo contains a complete deployment for Improved OCamCalib for Mac. It's based on [Improved OCamCalib](https://github.com/urbste/ImprovedOcamCalib) by Steffen Urban, which in turn is based on [OCamCalib](https://sites.google.com/site/scarabotix/ocamcalib-toolbox) by Davide Scaramuzza.

I've also included the zip files for the Mac and Windows versions of OCamCalib, as well as the source for the corner detector which is needed to use the Windows code for Linux, just in case the originals should go offline.
